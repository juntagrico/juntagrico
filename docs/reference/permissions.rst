Permissions
===========

.. note::
    Permissions are named in the language of your instance and use your terminology.

juntagrico relies heavily on the Django permission mechanism to customize the system for different users.
In this chapter we will explain which permissions can be used for customization and how they work.

Grant Permissions
-----------------

Create a group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Login with a super admin user.
2. Open the data management ("Datenverwaltung") -> Groups -> Add to create a new group or edit an existing one.
3. Set a name for the group, e.g. "share management".
4. Select and add the permissions (using the arrow to the right in the middle) that you want to give to this group and save the group.

What Permissions do I need to set?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are 4 basic permissions for each entity which are self explanatory:

* View
* Add
* Change
* Delete

.. hint::
    If a user should be able to change an entity, they also need access to at least view the related entities.
    See `Dependent Permissions <reference-dependent-permissions>` below.

Juntagrico provides some additional permissions, that are described in the sections below.

Add Users to the group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Login with a super admin user.
2. Open the data management ("Datenverwaltung") -> User ("Benutzer") and edit the user of the member you want to give the permissions to.
3. If the user needs access to the data management, tick staff status ("Mitarbeiter-Status").
4. Add the relevant groups for this user and save the user.

You may also give permissions do users directly but this is not recommended as it is then harder to transfer the same permissions to another user.

Testing the user access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be sure, that the user can do what you intended them to do, it is best to create a test user and give them the same permissions.
Try out all actions with the test user, to confirm that they work.

.. note::
    You can also test the permissions of a user by impersonating them. However, by default the data admin is excluded from impersonation.
    If you want to check the users permissions in the data admin as well, set the ``IMPERSONATE_URI_EXCLUSIONS`` setting to an empty list.
